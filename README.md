- [ ] \t = tab
- [ ] \r = carriage return
- [ ] \e = escape
- [ ] \’ = single quote
- [ ] \” = double quote
- [ ] \ = stop interpolation for next character

2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

- [ ] Addition = +
- [ ] Subtraction = -
- [ ] Multiplication = *
- [ ] Division = /
- [ ] Modulus = %
- [ ] Exponent = **
- [ ] Floor Division = //

3. OPERATORS

- [ ] Assignment = ex. x=y
- [ ] Add and assign += ex. x+=y is (x = x + y)
- [ ] Substract and assign -+ ex. x-=y is (x = x - y)
- [ ] Multiply and assign *= ex. x*=y is (x = x * y)
- [ ] Divide and assign is /= ex. x/=y is (x = x/y)
- [ ] Modulus and assign %= ex. x%=y is (x = x % y)
- [ ] Exponent and assign **= ex. **=y is (x = x ** y)
- [ ] Floor division and assign //= ex. x//=y is (x = x//y)

4. BOOLEAN LOGIC OPERATORS

- [ ] and 
  - T T - T
  - T F - F
  - F T - F
  - F F - F

- [ ] or
  - T T - T
  - T F - T
  - F T - T
  - F F - F
