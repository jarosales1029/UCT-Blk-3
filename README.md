OPERATORS

Assignment = ex. x=y

add and assign += ex. x+=y is (x = x + y)

substract and assign -+ ex. x-=y is (x = x - y)

multiply and assign *= ex. x*=y is (x = x * y)

divide and assign is /= ex. x/=y is (x = x/y)

modulus and assign %= ex. x%=y is (x = x % y)

exponent and assign **= ex. **=y is (x = x ** y)

floor division and assign //= ex. x//=y is (x = x//y)
