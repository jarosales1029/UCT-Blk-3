- Add and assign += ex. x+=y is (x = x + y)
- Substract and assign -+ ex. x-=y is (x = x - y)
- Multiply and assign *= ex. x*=y is (x = x * y)
- Divide and assign is /= ex. x/=y is (x = x/y)
- Modulus and assign %= ex. x%=y is (x = x % y)
- Exponent and assign **= ex. **=y is (x = x ** y)
- Floor division and assign //= ex. x//=y is (x = x//y)
